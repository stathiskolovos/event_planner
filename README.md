# Lab: Function Component Event Planner Landing Page

In this lab, you are going to create a landing page for an organization that plans personal and corporate events. You will create the EventPlanner component that consists of various sections, such as the description of the application, event categories, features, testimonials, contact form, and footer. Each section describes various aspects of the Event Planner app, such as the types of events that can be planned, the app's main features, customer reviews, and how to get in touch with the service provider.

You will structure the React component using JSX syntax and use basic HTML elements such as div, header, and h1. Additionally, you will gain insight into the importance of maintaining a clear and organized code structure, as well as the role of component reusability and modularity in building scalable React applications.

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Create a structured hierarchy of React components to organize the layout of the Event Planner landing page ensuring easy maintenance of issues
2. Write the user interface elements, such as headers, paragraphs, lists, and buttons, using JSX code
3. Use dynamic content rendering to show testimonials, event categories, and features that are dynamically fetched from data sources
4. Use semantic HTML markup to ensure usability and search engine optimization (SEO) benefits
